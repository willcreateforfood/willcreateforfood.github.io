          <h1>Boulder County: Waste Less Food</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          <p>This project started when Boulder County partnered with a senior campaigns course to address the issue of food waste. Their challenge to us was to advertise a week of events to raise awareness in Boulder County.</p>
          <p>Working with a group of students, we aimed to build a larger community around food waste by building off of pre-existing communities. To do so, we created a brand that members of the organic and local food movements could relate to. These communities were most likely to rally behind our cause because of the pre-existing interest in food.</p>
          <p>Waste Less Food was a campaign aimed towards individuals who cared where their food came from. We wanted them to not only think about their foods origin but start to consider what happens to their uneaten food as well. Focusing on sustainability and personal finance, our campaign not only raised awareness of how food waste personally affects our audience, but also, drew audience members to Boulder County's week of events.</p>
          <p>Elements of the branding were used to promote Boulder Countyâ€™s 2018 Food Awareness Week.</p>
